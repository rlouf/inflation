The idea is that while the CPI reflects a reality, this reality is not perceived the same everywhere (regional differences) and by everyone (basket differences). It is also not very actionable since variations are likely to be differentiated between items.

* How to compute the CPI from individual price indices

There is a formula with weights, but there is no way I am going to have enought time to compute all the weights from data; even if I had infinite time I would have a hard time reproduce the BLS's exact CPI value. But this is not what is important here. So we can randomize or play with the weights.

1. Find set of weights s.t. changes are minimized

* Decompose the CPI

#+begin_src python
import sqlite3

query = """SELECT ...
           FROM series
           ORDER BY (year, month)"""
#+end_src

/Wild idea:/ inflation is the result of normal market competition, price slippage is to be expect in a competitive environment.
